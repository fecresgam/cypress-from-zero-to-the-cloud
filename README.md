# cypress-from-zero-to-the-cloud

Project that contains my solution to [cypress-from-zero-to-the-cloud](https://github.com/wlsf82/cypress-from-zero-to-the-cloud) course. 

## Pre-requirements

It is required to have git, Node.js and npm installed to clone and run this project.

> I used versions `2.34.1`, `v18.15.0`, and `9.5.0.` of git, Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later LTS versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

Run `npm test` (or `npm t` for the short version) to run the tests in headless mode.

Or, run `npm run cy:open` to open the Cypress App and run the tests in interactive mode.
